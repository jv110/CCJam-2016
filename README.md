# SolidEngine

SolidEngine is a very powerful and easy to use game engine, capable of rendering in 2D, 3D and raycasted 3D with no lag.

The engine consists of everything necessary to make a game: graphics, user input, physics, and sound.

Check the wiki for documentation.

# Building

SolidEngine uses [make] (http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/26048-lua-make-lua-pre-processor-for-computercraft/page__pid__253687) for building.

To build a SolidEngine project, just add the SolidEngine source as a dependency in your makefile.

# Notes

- Playing sounds requires either command computers or a sound.connect(side) call to connect to a command block.
- 3D and raycasting aren't implemented yet.
